These include but are not limited to:  
1. Requirements Engineering (Collecting customer stories to define core features or similar)
2. Software Architecture (Utilizing UML Diagrams and other tools to define the structure of the software)
3. Software Design (Planning the development process based on established operational frameworks)
4. Software Development (Implementing the software based on the principle of test driven development and established design patterns)
