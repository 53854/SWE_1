# **Software Engineering** - WiSe 2022/23
 
This Document roughly outlines the project structure and requirements.

## **Team Roles**

Unanimously agreed upon roles for the team members:

| **Role** | **Team Member** |
| :--- | ---: |
| **Product Owner** | @Dennis |
| **Scrum Master** | @Sebastian |
| **Developer** | @Niko |
| **Designer** | @Eddy |

These merely discribe the roles of the team members, but do not necessarily reflect the actual workload of each team member, which is intended to end up roughly equal.

Development of the project is done in a Scrum framework, with the our sprint planning listed on trello [here](https://trello.com/b/1Z7Z7Z7Z/software-engineering-101).

## **Project requirements**
The project is intended to be devloped and documented by a team of 4 students, displaying core concepts of the Software Engineering Process.  
These include but are not limited to:  
1. Requirements Engineering (Collecting customer stories to define core features or similar)
2. Software Architecture (Utilizing UML Diagrams and other tools to define the structure of the software)
3. Software Design (Planning the development process based on established operational frameworks)
4. Software Development (Implementing the software based on the principle of test driven development and established design patterns)

### **App requirements** 
  - application responds quickly
  - application is easy to use
  - available on multiple platforms
  - Users can track their expenses
    - add, modify and delete expenses and income
    - define periodicity of recurring expenses and income
    - list of all expenses
    - weekly / monthly / ... overview of expenses | summary 
    - categorization / tagging / filtering
